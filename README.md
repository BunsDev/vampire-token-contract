Vampire (FTM) Source Code.

Vampire (VAMP) is an FTM exclusive token that uses a jackpot mechanism to bring up the price floor during a buyback.

The Jackpot is awarded to the last buyer of VAMP that has been the last buyer for 10 minutes. If the Jackpot hits the hard limit of $100,000, 70% of the Jackpot FTM is used to buy back and burn during Morbin Time, which raises the price floor.

The Jackpot delivers FTM meaning both your money in VAMP and your winnings in the Jackpot are safe from a sudden sale.

Anyone can purchase VAMP to become the new last buyer and reset the timer to 10 minutes. 
A $10 or more purchase of VAMP is required to win the Jackpot.

The Jackpot and Morbin Time bring up the price floor as VAMP is bought back and burned.
New buyers are incentivized because there is always a Jackpot to be won.
Sellers are discouraged because of the 8% sell tax, which sucks the FTM into the Jackpot.

The code is all original, no forking involved and no copying from other projects.
